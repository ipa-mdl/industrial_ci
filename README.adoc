CI (Continuous Integration) configuration for ROS (http://ros.org[Robot
Operating System]). This is the refactored version with ROS2 support,
the old verson can be found in the
https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/tree/legacy[legacy
branch]. Please check the link:doc/migration_guide.md[migration guide]
as well.

[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

This package contains
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration[CI (Continuous
Integration)] scripts that any ROS-powered packages can commonly use.
Some notable feature:

* Checks if your package builds, installs without issues. If unit/system
tests are defined run them.
http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/PrereleaseTest[ROS Prerelease Test]
can optionally be run.
* Proven to cover the general requirements of the ROS-based robotics
repositories. Easily configurable.
* Users can add custom pre/post processes.
* Covers ROS1 Indigo, Jade, Kinetic, Lunar, Melodic, Noetic and ROS2
distributions.
* This repo provides scripts for Bitbucket CI, Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions
and Travis CI only, but it can be easily adapted for other CI services.

community meeting]

[[quick-start]]
Quick Start
-----------

With a few steps, you can start in your client repository using CI
confiurations stored in industrial_ci.

[[for-travis-ci]]
For Travis CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Activate CI for your github repository on
https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI]). You may do so either at
https://travis-ci.org/profile/YOUR_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION or at
https://travis-ci.org/profile/YOUR_GITHUB_USER (depending on where your
repository sits).
2.  Add .travis.yml file to your repository root
(https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci/blob/master/doc/.travis.yml[complete
template]):

....
language: generic
services:
  - docker

env:
  matrix:
    - ROS_DISTRO="indigo"

install:
  - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci.git .industrial_ci -b master
script:
  - .industrial_ci/travis.sh
....

* Note: The name .industrial_ci is NO longer REQUIRED for the cloned
folder starting version 0.3.2; you can pick any name (recommended
practice to keep the folder hidden (by prepending ".").

[[for-gitlab-ci]]
For Gitlab CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/[official doc] for the steps
to do so. Note for Gitlab CI, necessary steps might be different between
hosted version (i.e. the one on gitlab.com) v.s. the one on your own
server, which Gitlab doesn't always clarify in its documentation.::
  1.  For your server version, enable a runner for your Gitlab project
  which uses the Docker executor. See instructions on how to
  https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html[install] and
  https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html[register] such a
  runner with your Gitlab instance if you haven't done so yet.

1.  In .gitlab-ci.yml file in your client repo, add the following
minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content of the
file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:

....
image: docker:git
services:
  - docker:dind
before_script:
  - apk add --update bash coreutils tar
  - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master
indigo:
  script: .industrial_ci/gitlab.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo
....

[[for-bitbucket-pipelines]]
For Bitbucket Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Enable CI for your repo. Please refer to
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines-792298921.html[official
doc] for the steps to do so.
2.  In the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file in your client repo, add the
following minimal configuration (this snippet can be the entire content
of the file), replacing indigo for your chosen distro:

....
image: docker:git

pipelines:
  default:
     - step:
         services:
           - docker
         script:
           - apk add --update bash coreutils tar
           - git clone --quiet --depth 1 https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_ci .industrial_ci -b master
           - .industrial_ci/bitbucket.sh ROS_DISTRO=indigo

definitions:
  services:
    docker:
      memory: 2048
....

[[for-github-actions]]
For GitHub Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Create .github/workflows/industrial_ci_action.yml
(industrial_ci_action.yml is arbitrary,
link:doc/industrial_ci_action.yml[complete template]) with the following
configuration, (this snippet can be the entire content of the file),
replacing melodic for your chosen distro:

....
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  industrial_ci:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        env:
          - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: testing}
          - {ROS_DISTRO: melodic, ROS_REPO: main}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: 'ros-industrial/industrial_ci@master'
        env: ${{matrix.env}}
....

[[metrics]]
Metrics
-------

There might not an easy way to precisely count how many repositories out
there are using industrial_ci. Counting that number isn't even our
priority at all, but we're often simply curious. Here's some ways that
give us some clues for the usage metrics:

Excluding industrial_ci repo):
